**Problem Statement**

* One of the key metrics to measure a business success is by measuring its customer churn rate - the lower the churn, the more loved the company is.
* Typically, every user of a product or a service is assigned a prediction value that estimates their state of churn at any given time. This value may be based on multiple factors such as the userâ€™s demographic, their browsing behavior and historical purchase data, among other details.
* This value factors in unique and proprietary predictions of how long a user will remain a customer and is updated every day for all users who have purchased at least one of the products/services and values assigned are between 1 and 5.


**Goal**

The goal of this competition was to develop a machine learning model to predict the churn score of a customer based on different features.


**Machine Learning Model**

XGBoost Classifier to get to a score of 63.04918 and it was evaluated by score = 100 x metrics.f1_score(actual, predicted, average="macro").


**Rank**

315/4189.
